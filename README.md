# Course 0:  setup and configuration
This contains the setup and system configuration instructions for users.  Users participating in a class will come to this page to determine what system requirements are needed (or recommended) to take full advantage of the course material.  

* Possible items that could be useful: 
  * Anaconda (Python 3.0 or higher, https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)  
  * set up your own git repository?
  * More advanced packages not in Anaconda?
  * Sunpy (https://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/installation/)
  * Helio-ML setup instructions:  https://register-as.oma.be/sdo2018/python-setup.php
  * diagnostics to make sure things are working properly?

*In construction!  

# Course 0

#### Goal:  Course 0 is to ensure that the computer you will be using for the python classes is fully set up and configured so you can get started.  This involves getting packages installed, computers configured, everything updated to the correct versions, etc. so students can participate hands-on in class with minimal in-class debugging.  

#### Timeline:  1-2 hours, done prior to taking a course.  

#### Requirements:  The computer you’ll be using in the course. If you don’t have privileges to install software then you’ll have to work with your systems administrator. 

#### Instructors:  Misc.


* Step 1:  Install Anaconda Navigator
Navigator is a useful interface to manage packages and development environments. 

  * If you do not have Anaconda installed, go to https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
  * If you do have Anaconda installed, make sure it’s version 1.9.x (The current distribution 2018.12 is ~1.9.6) 
  * [What are explicit specifications to make sure everyone has what’s needed?  Can we get a checklist?]

* Step 2:  Test your configuration
  * You should try to have Python version 3.7.x  (though 3.5 or above should be sufficient).  
  * Type python --version at a Mac or unix command prompt
